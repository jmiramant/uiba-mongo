## Instructions

#### Development

Development is a breeze. Once you have installed all your dependencies all the configuration is done for you. using simple The process is outlined [here](docs/development.md).

#### Unit Tests

Testing with:
- `karma` as test runner
	- `karma.conf.js` for the main karma configuration (it has webpack configurations)
	- `tests.webpack.js` which is the single entry file. It uses `webpack`'s require API to find all the files we need that have a `-test.js` suffix.
- `mocha` as the test framework
- `jsdom` as my test environment

```bash
# Run test once
npm test

# Run in watch mode
npm test:watch
